/**
 * Adds gateway-local fields (e.g. parseUserAgent, geolocateIP, sessions,
 * deleteSession) to the unified graph schema produced by the Hive Router
 * and routes both their execution and any introspection of them through
 * the default GraphQL executor.
 *
 * Two phases:
 *
 * 1. `onSchemaChange` – extends the router's schema with our type defs +
 *    resolvers so that validation succeeds for local fields and so that
 *    introspection (when run against this extended schema) returns the
 *    union of federated + local types. The Hive Router
 *    (`@graphql-hive/router-runtime`'s `unifiedGraphHandler`) ignores
 *    `additionalTypeDefs` / `additionalResolvers` on `createGatewayRuntime`
 *    config, so we have to do it ourselves here.
 *
 * 2. `onExecute` – for operations whose top-level fields are all local
 *    resolvers, all introspection meta-fields, or a mix of the two,
 *    swap the executor for the default `graphql.execute`. Otherwise the
 *    router would try to plan the operation against the supergraph SDL
 *    (which knows nothing about local fields) and either fail with
 *    "Field 'X' not found in type 'Query'" for local execution or return
 *    an SDL-only introspection result that hides the local schema.
